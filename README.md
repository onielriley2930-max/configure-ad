<p>Active Directory is like a digital phonebook and security guard for computers in a company or school.
It helps keep track of people, computers, and what they’re allowed to do on the network.

So instead of every computer trying to remember every person, Active Directory is the “brain” that remembers it all. So When a company moves to the cloud (like Microsoft Azure), instead of keeping everything stored on physical servers in the office, they use Microsoft’s data centers to host their network.

This means the “brain” of Active Directory — the system that stores all users, passwords, and permissions — now lives online instead of on a local server.

That cloud version of Active Directory is called:

 Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)

Next is the cloud. The cloud is just someone else’s powerful computer (server) that you rent space or services from over the internet.

So instead of storing user accounts, passwords, and files on a physical server in your office,
you let Microsoft’s Azure servers handle it all safely online.
